## üíº Project

The site is for a fictitious company that wants to sell a service to lawyers, it is a Landing Page that has the sole purpose of informing about the product, the problem it solves and a means of contact.

## üìñ Goal

It was created to understand how Vercel deploy works and how to publish it in a real domain and also to use external email services.

I used Registro.br for this, at first, I just deployed it at Vercel, after that I bought a domain at Registro.br, took the DNS that Vercel offers me after deploying it, and added it to my domain's DNS in the Registry .br, after a few hours it was online.

The e-mail service, I used Umbler, after buying a package, I just added Umbler's DNS to Vercel to communicate with my domain.

Note: Currently I no longer use the domain, only Vercel's.
